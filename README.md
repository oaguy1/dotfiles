# dotfiles
My dotfiles for GNU Stow. Right now it is mainly my basic vim configurations and nothing else. I plan on adding more as I branch out.

To install the configurations, simply run `stow <config folder>` for each of the desired configurations. If you make a mistake and need to remove the symlink, then run `stow -D <config folder>`.

## vim
Vim is **the** text editor and I like mine configured closely to stock with some of the creature comforts enabled.
